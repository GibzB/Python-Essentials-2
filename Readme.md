# Modules, Packages, and PIP


### What is a module?
# It is a file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be later imported and used when necessary.

## Namespace
### Is a space (understood in a non-physical context) in which some names exist and the names don't conflict with each other (i.e., there are not two different objects of the same name).
