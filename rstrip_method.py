# rstrip method

# Two variants of the rstrip() method do nearly the same as lstrips, 
#   but affect the opposite side of the string.
# The rstrip() method returns a string after removing all trailing whitespaces (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc) from the RIGHT end.
# The rstrip() method takes one parameter:

# Demonstrating the rstrip() method:
print("[" + " upsilon ".rstrip() + "]")
print("cisco.com".rstrip(".com")) # This line removes the ".com" suffix from the string.
                                # Any letter associated with ".com" is removed
